Hi~ I'm Hacc, a Linux enthusiast.

I have a thing for ~~cheap~~ "jank" hardware. I often find myself browsing second-hand platforms or online communities, and then I start ~~impulse~~ buying all sorts of quirky gear. Since I'm a noob but love to mess around with things, I often end up with some pretty ~~janky~~ interesting projects.

This blog is mainly for documenting the pitfalls I've encountered during my tinkering, or for sharing my experiences with various peculiar hardware and software setups.

As for where the name "Hacc" comes from, many people assume it's a play on the word "Hack."

While I'm fine with that interpretation now, the real reason is that I'm terrible at coming up with names. Shortly after I started surfing the web, I urgently needed an English ID to register for various things. So, I just picked a few English letters that I thought had no meaning and wouldn't clash with other abbreviations. Of course, I soon found out that this ID is not only a meme but also an abbreviation for a ton of other things. But since I've been using it for so long, I couldn't be bothered to change it.

This blog will be updated sporadically ~~whenever my procrastination gets better~~, on a whim.
