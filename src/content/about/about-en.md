Hi~ I'm Hacc, a [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/linux.html) enthusiast.

The distributions I commonly use are [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/), [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), and [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) / [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).

For my desktop and more powerful machines in my home lab, I prefer using [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/). ~~Even though a source-based distribution uses a lot of electricity,~~ its biggest advantage is how easy it is to patch things yourself, which is a perfect match for some of the quirky hardware that needs a few tweaks to get running. When you run into a fresh upstream bug, you can easily downgrade as long as the API hasn't changed, without worrying about breaking the ABI. The overlay also makes it incredibly convenient to create your own software repositoryâ€”you just start a Git repo, ~~and it's pure joy to stuff your own packages in there without having to push them upstream.~~

For less powerful desktops and home lab machines, as someone who likes to chase the latest versions, I lean towards [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). With these machines at home, it doesn't really matter if a rolling update pulls in a fresh upstream bug and breaks everything. ~~After all, I have plenty of backup machines, so if one breaks, I'll just wait for upstream to fix it.~~

In production environments, where I don't want things breaking and needing fixes every day, I prefer to use [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) / [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). Their update strategies aren't as aggressive, and the latter is a proper commercial distribution, so it should be a bit more reliable than the others I mentioned, ~~although I've been burned by [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) plenty of times too.~~

I also have a thing for ~~cheap~~ "jank" hardware. I often find myself browsing second-hand platforms or online communities, and then I start ~~impulse~~ buying all sorts of quirky gear. Since I'm a noob but love to mess around with things, I often end up with some pretty ~~janky~~ interesting projects.

This blog is mainly for documenting the pitfalls I've encountered during my tinkering, or for sharing my experiences with various peculiar hardware and software setups.

As for where the name "Hacc" comes from, many people assume it's a play on the word "Hack".

While I'm fine with that interpretation now, the real reason is that I'm terrible at coming up with names. Shortly after I started surfing the web, I urgently needed an English ID to register for various things. So, I just picked a few English letters that I thought had no meaning and wouldn't clash with other abbreviations. Of course, I soon found out that this ID is not only a meme but also an abbreviation for a ton of other things. But since I've been using it for so long, I couldn't be bothered to change it.

This blog will be updated sporadically ~~whenever my procrastination gets better~~, on a whim.
